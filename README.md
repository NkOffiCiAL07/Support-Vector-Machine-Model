# Support-Vector-Machine-Model
This model is implemented using svm classifier that determines the contamination level of water samples as 1 (Low), 2 (Medium) or 3 (High). lets go through the problem description below :-

Imagine that the government of India has hired you as an Al/ML expert for the 'Namami Ganga', an initiative taken up by the government to clean the Ganga. The samples of Ganga water, collected from various contaminated areas, are given to you. Your task is to develop a model that determines the contamination level of the water. Using your model, the government will form an action plan for the initiative.
